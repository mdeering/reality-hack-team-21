## Through Their Eyes
## Inspiration
In the United States, 1 in 12 men have colorblindness. Mixed Reality offers a unique opportunity for people with vision deficiencies', including colorblindness to experience the world vibrantly in a way they haven't seen before. 
##What it does 
Through Their Eyes presents and supports the experience of being colorblind, while also offering and facilitating colorblind adaptation for those with colorblindness.  
## How we built it
Unity 6, Meta Quest 3, Passthrough Layers, Environmental Depth Sensor, Custom Chromatic Presets, Davinci Resolve LUTS, Substance Painter, Photoshop, Blender, Wacom, GitHub
##Challenges we ran into
Our target audience necessitates a user-centered research approach but we had trouble finding colorblind individuals to playtest. Thus, we utilized our online and in-person connections to seek out playtesters for our product. 
While attempting to imitate color blindness in passthrough mode, we ran into layer issues due to camera constraints, limiting our access to passthrough. We were able to resolve the issue through online research and help from Meta mentors who are familiar with state-of-the-art frameworks such as EnvironmentRaycastManager, only available in the most recent version (v72). 
##Accomplishments that we're proud of
Working with playtesters with colorblindness, our team's designer created spectrums of chromatic aberrations corresponding to their specific conditions (tritanopia, deuteranopia). It was impressive to witness the priceless reaction our colorblind users had to using our product, which allows them to experience the world in a way they have never experienced before. 
##What we learned
Colorblindness is a spectrum, and the differences between different conditions (tritanopia, deuteranopia, protanopia) are not commonly considered in accessibility. We also explored the use of cutting edge MR technology which allows for multiple passthrough layers. 
## What's next for Through Their Eyes
We plan on optimizing the hand tracking and onboarding experience for the user. In addition, users will be able to customize presets according to their experience.
